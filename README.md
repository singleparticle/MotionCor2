# Background
## MotionCor2
Correction of electron beam-induced sample motion is one of the major factors contributing to the recent resolution 
breakthroughs in cryo-electron microscopy. Based on observations that the electron beam induces doming of the thin 
vitreous ice layer, we developed an algorithm to correct anisotropic image motion at the single pixel level across 
the whole frame, suitable for both single particle and tomographic images. Iterative, patch-based motion detection 
is combined with spatial and temporal constraints and dose weighting. The multi-GPU accelerated program, MotionCor2, 
is sufficiently fast to keep up with automated data collection. The result is an exceptionally robust strategy that 
can work on a wide range of data sets, including those very close to focus or with very short integration times, 
obviating the need for particle polishing. Application significantly improves Thon ring quality and 3D reconstruction 
resolution.<br>
